# GC Praesidium community

This repository accompanies the **GC-arc (Germinal Centre governance) series**, a sequence of
conceptual and mathematical papers developing a **capacity-limited governance framework**
for adaptive immune systems.

The programme examines how germinal centres maintain stability under competing pressures
from mutation, selection, diversity, and regulation, and how distinct failure modes arise
when governance capacity is exceeded or misaligned.

All papers are archived on Zenodo with permanent DOIs.

## GC-arc8 (current synthesis)

**Immune-complex architecture resolves the antigen-persistence paradox in B-cell memory**

James Sutton (2026)

📄 Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18176310

GC-arc8 provides a biological synthesis of the GC-arc programme, focusing on experimental
immunology rather than mathematical derivation. It reframes immune memory as a governed,
multi-layer process in which **antigen accessibility**, **immune-complex architecture**, and
**inhibitory Fc receptor signalling** determine when memory is expressed rather than whether
it exists.

Key contributions include:
- resolution of the long-standing paradox between antigen-independent memory persistence and
  antigen-dependent recall;
- treatment of immune complexes as structured, mechanically and signalling-governed
  intermediates rather than passive antigen depots;
- integration of IgM/J-chain/complement architecture with FcγRIIB-mediated inhibitory gating;
- interpretation of latent memory as an active governance state rather than failure;
- synthesis of instability ridge, hysteresis, and oligoclonal capture concepts into
  germinal-centre biology.

GC-arc8 serves as the immunological capstone of the series and is written as a conceptual
review suitable for perspective and synthesis contexts.

## GC-arc7

**Oligoclonal Capture as a Failure Mode of Governance in Adaptive Systems:  
Implications for Immune Stability, Chronic Disease, and Global Health**

James Sutton (2025–2026)

📄 Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18163641

GC-arc7 identifies **oligoclonal capture** as a generic failure mode of capacity-limited
governance in adaptive systems, synthesising experimental immunology, Bayesian inference,
and dynamical systems theory. It argues that chronic immune pathologies can arise from
collapse of comparative selection and recoverability rather than from excessive activation
or defective tolerance alone.

## The GC-arc series (papers 1–8)

The GC-arc series develops in stages:

- **GC-arc2 / Immuno2** – Germinal centres as governed biological systems; instability of
  strict monoclonality and limits of unstructured diversity.
- **GC-arc3 / Immuno3** – Discovery of a migration-driven instability ridge in germinal-centre
  governance.
- **GC-arc4 / Math2** – Minimal mathematical framework for capacity-limited governance,
  hysteresis, and recovery failure.
- **GC-arc5** – Temperature- and recovery-like effects in adaptive systems; diversity
  requires structure.
- **GC-arc6** – Constraint-driven collapse as a unifying principle across molecular and
  immune contexts.
- **GC-arc7** – Oligoclonal capture as a failure mode with implications for chronic disease.
- **GC-arc8** – Biological synthesis resolving antigen persistence, latent memory, immune
  complexes, and Fc-mediated governance in B-cell memory.

This repository is intended as an open, versioned record of the GC-arc programme.
Individual papers may be read independently, but the full series documents the progressive
development of a governance-based interpretation of germinal-centre function and immune
memory.
### GC-arc1  
**Civilisation as a Gene Mangler: A Questioned Dialogue with Earth Logic**  
James Sutton (2025)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18109520

Establishes the foundational systems question motivating the GC-arc programme: whether
civilisation-scale structures act as adaptive selectors or as gene-mangling environments that
distort evolutionary and immune logic. Framed as a dialogical inquiry rather than a technical
model, GC-arc1 introduces the concept of *Earth logic*—the constraint-driven selection regime
under which biological systems evolved—and contrasts it with modern high-throughput,
low-governance social systems. This paper sets the philosophical and systems-theoretic context
for later formalisation of capacity-limited governance, instability ridges, and recovery failure
in germinal-centre immunology.

### GC-arc2  
**Geometry–Time Governance in Adaptive Dynamical Systems**  
James Sutton (2026)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18147840

Introduces the general concept of governance under finite capacity, focusing on admissibility,
temporal ordering, and persistence independent of optimisation.

### GC-arc3  
**A Migration-Driven Instability Ridge in Germinal-Centre Governance as a Systems Framework for Autoimmune Risk**  
James Sutton (2025)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18109610

Applies capacity-limited governance to germinal centres, identifying a non-monotonic instability
ridge driven by effective lineage migration and mixing.

---

### GC-arc4  
**Capacity-Limited Governance and Instability in Adaptive Dynamical Systems**  
James Sutton (2025)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18109667

Formalises the general mathematics of capacity-limited regulation, variance amplification,
hysteresis, and recovery failure across adaptive systems.

### GC-arc5  
**Governance, Temperature, and Recovery: Why Diversity Requires Structure Across Biology and Society**  
James Sutton (2026)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18134579

Extends the governance framework beyond immunity, showing how diversity, perturbation
intensity (“temperature”), and recovery interact across biological and social systems.

---

### GC-arc6  
**Constraint-Driven Collapse as a Unifying Principle of Molecular and Immune Function**  
James Sutton (2025)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18110023

Unifies molecular and immune failure modes as loss of admissibility and recoverability under
constraint collapse, rather than pathway-specific malfunction.

---

### GC-arc7  
**Oligoclonal Capture as a Failure Mode of Governance in Adaptive Systems**  
James Sutton (2026)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18163641

Defines oligoclonal capture, integrates Bayesian and capacity-limited formalisms, and connects
germinal-centre governance failure to chronic immune disease and public-health fragility.

## Scope and positioning

- The GC-arc series is **independent of the GQR/QGE programme**.
- All mathematics used here is **classical**, drawing on dynamical systems, control theory,
  and Bayesian inference.
- The novelty lies in **importing ridge-structured, capacity-limited governance concepts into
  immunology**, particularly in the context of somatic hypermutation and germinal-centre dynamics.

---

## Intended audience

- Immunologists and clinician-scientists
- Systems biologists
- Researchers studying chronic immune disease, relapse, and recovery
- Readers interested in governance and stability of adaptive biological systems
