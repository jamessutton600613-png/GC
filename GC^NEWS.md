## GC-arc programme update (January 2026)

Three closely linked works have now been released on Zenodo and added to the
**Germinal Center (GC) community**, marking a major consolidation point for the
GC-arc / GQR research programme.

Together, these papers formalise a transition from descriptive and statistical
models of germinal-centre dynamics to an explicitly **governed accessibility**
framework, in which immune outcomes are constrained by structural invariants
rather than inferred from cohort-averaged optimisation or probability alone.

### New releases

- **GC-arc9 / Math5 / GQR35 — Pruning Dynamics and the Regeneration of Admissible Paths**  
  Introduces the concept of admissible-path collapse under accumulating
  constraints, providing a formal mechanism for governance failure and recovery
  in adaptive systems.  
  Zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18215529

- **GC-arc10 — Thresholded Immune State Transitions and Lag Dynamics in Therapeutic Peptide Vaccination for Chronic Hepatitis B**  
  A state-based re-analysis of the BRII-179 trial demonstrating that immune
  responses segregate into discrete trajectories, contradicting Gaussian
  averaging assumptions and motivating invariant-aware analysis.  
  Zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18299345

- **GC-arc11 — Invariant-governed accessibility constrains somatic hypermutation and immune fate**  
  Establishes invariant-governed reachability as a unifying principle for
  germinal-centre biology, explaining how extreme local stochasticity in somatic
  hypermutation produces sharply constrained outcomes in affinity maturation,
  memory commitment, and clonal survival.  
  Zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18329953

### Programme context

These works jointly connect:
- germinal-centre architecture and regulation,
- somatic hypermutation and selection,
- immune memory versus latency versus autoimmunity,
- and formal methods from Petri nets, invariant analysis, and governed dynamical
  systems.

They also provide the biological grounding for the **Gated Invariant Covering
Technique (GICT)**, developed and benchmarked separately using PNML models
(Dining Philosophers, Token Ring, Piscine and variants), which demonstrates
order-of-magnitude improvements over standard LP-based feasibility analysis.

Further supplementary materials, benchmark suites, and implementation details
are archived alongside these records and will continue to be updated within the
GC Zenodo community.




## 🧬 GC (Germinal Centre) Community — News Update  

**January 2026**

### New manuscript (in submission with JHEP reports)

**Thresholded Immune State Transitions and Lag Dynamics in Therapeutic Peptide Vaccination for Chronic Hepatitis B**  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18299345  
A state-based statistical re-analysis of therapeutic vaccination data demonstrating that immune responses do **not** evolve smoothly. Instead, responses occur via **discrete state transitions and lag phases**, helping explain responder and non-responder segregation that is obscured by cohort averaging.


### Newly released from pre-GQR (mid 2025) personal archives.

Two manuscripts (with alts, relateds) arising from the **Germinal Centre (GC)** research stream that became my two github (GQR and GC) communities, are now available.  

**The Quantum-Classical Tumbling Locomotion (QC-TCL) Hypothesis**  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18299933  
A unifying biological framework proposing that **geometry-constrained tumbling, pivoting, and cyclic motion** underlies catalysis, self-assembly, and biological selection, without invoking long-lived quantum coherence.

Together, this selection of  related manuscripts explore how **thresholds, geometry, and constrained motion** shape immune and biochemical outcomes — concepts central to germinal centre dynamics, affinity maturation, and immune decision-making.

This work represents a **mechanistic bridge between early biochemical intuition and later geometry-first quantum formalism**.

**6D Rotary Engines: A Mechanistic Framework for Simplification of Delocalised π-Electron Catalytic Mechanisms**  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18300110  
The paper introduces rotary, pivoting, and tethered geometries as a means of simplifying complex delocalised electronic behaviour, using Fourier-resolved wave amplification and geometry-gated tunnelling pathways.

The manuscript perhaps belongs better with the **jamessutton600613-png/GQR github community** and focuses on **geometry-first quantum mechanisms**, distinct from immunological or clinical analyses.  The reader may be interested to see how the GQR line is thus ontologically linked to Germinal Center Biological reasoning.  It is included here for that reason.  

## 📜 Why These Historical Drafts Are Being Released

These manuscripts are released in their historical form because they capture the **biological and biochemical reasoning layer that preceded formal physics (including Hamiltonians...), mathematical, and computer-science abstraction** within the wider programme.

They may be of assistance to readers because they:

- Show how problems were **first framed biologically**, before reduction into equations or code  
- Preserve **mechanistic intuitions** (geometry, thresholds, motion, lag) often lost after formalisation  
- Provide **conceptual entry points** for domain experts outside quantum physics or computational modelling  
- Document the **evolution of ideas**, not just their final filtered expressions  

These drafts are therefore not superseded.  
They are **foundational context**, explaining why later physics-, mathematics-, and code-level models took the form they did.
