# GC Praesidium community

This repository accompanies the **GC-arc (Germinal Centre governance) series**, a sequence of
conceptual and mathematical papers developing a **capacity-limited governance framework** for
adaptive immune systems.

The series culminates in **GC-arc7**, which introduces **oligoclonal capture** as a distinct
failure mode of germinal-centre regulation, with implications for immune stability, chronic
disease, and global health.

All papers are archived on Zenodo with permanent DOIs.

## GC-arc7 (current paper)

**Oligoclonal Capture as a Failure Mode of Governance in Adaptive Systems:  
Implications for Immune Stability, Chronic Disease, and Global Health**

James Sutton (2025-2026)

📄 Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18163641

GC-arc7 synthesises experimental immunology, Bayesian inference, and capacity-limited dynamical
systems to propose that certain chronic immune pathologies arise not from excessive activation
or defective tolerance alone, but from **collapse of comparative selection and recoverability**
under finite regulatory capacity.

## The GC-arc series (papers 1–7)

### GC-arc1  
**Civilisation as a Gene Mangler: A Questioned Dialogue with Earth Logic**  
James Sutton (2025)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18109520

Establishes the foundational systems question motivating the GC-arc programme: whether
civilisation-scale structures act as adaptive selectors or as gene-mangling environments that
distort evolutionary and immune logic. Framed as a dialogical inquiry rather than a technical
model, GC-arc1 introduces the concept of *Earth logic*—the constraint-driven selection regime
under which biological systems evolved—and contrasts it with modern high-throughput,
low-governance social systems. This paper sets the philosophical and systems-theoretic context
for later formalisation of capacity-limited governance, instability ridges, and recovery failure
in germinal-centre immunology.

### GC-arc2  
**Geometry–Time Governance in Adaptive Dynamical Systems**  
James Sutton (2026)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18147840

Introduces the general concept of governance under finite capacity, focusing on admissibility,
temporal ordering, and persistence independent of optimisation.

### GC-arc3  
**A Migration-Driven Instability Ridge in Germinal-Centre Governance as a Systems Framework for Autoimmune Risk**  
James Sutton (2025)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18109610

Applies capacity-limited governance to germinal centres, identifying a non-monotonic instability
ridge driven by effective lineage migration and mixing.

---

### GC-arc4  
**Capacity-Limited Governance and Instability in Adaptive Dynamical Systems**  
James Sutton (2025)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18109667

Formalises the general mathematics of capacity-limited regulation, variance amplification,
hysteresis, and recovery failure across adaptive systems.

---

### GC-arc5  
**Governance, Temperature, and Recovery: Why Diversity Requires Structure Across Biology and Society**  
James Sutton (2026)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18134579

Extends the governance framework beyond immunity, showing how diversity, perturbation
intensity (“temperature”), and recovery interact across biological and social systems.

---

### GC-arc6  
**Constraint-Driven Collapse as a Unifying Principle of Molecular and Immune Function**  
James Sutton (2025)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18110023

Unifies molecular and immune failure modes as loss of admissibility and recoverability under
constraint collapse, rather than pathway-specific malfunction.

---

### GC-arc7  
**Oligoclonal Capture as a Failure Mode of Governance in Adaptive Systems**  
James Sutton (2026)  
📄 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18163641

Defines oligoclonal capture, integrates Bayesian and capacity-limited formalisms, and connects
germinal-centre governance failure to chronic immune disease and public-health fragility.

## Scope and positioning

- The GC-arc series is **independent of the GQR/QGE programme**.
- All mathematics used here is **classical**, drawing on dynamical systems, control theory,
  and Bayesian inference.
- The novelty lies in **importing ridge-structured, capacity-limited governance concepts into
  immunology**, particularly in the context of somatic hypermutation and germinal-centre dynamics.

---

## Intended audience

- Immunologists and clinician-scientists
- Systems biologists
- Researchers studying chronic immune disease, relapse, and recovery
- Readers interested in governance and stability of adaptive biological systems
